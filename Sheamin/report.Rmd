```{r setup_1, message=FALSE}

# Loading tidyverse library
library(tidyverse)
```

## Price Data

```{r}

```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to
prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
